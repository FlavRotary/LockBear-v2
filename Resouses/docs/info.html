  <h1>The Epic Lock Bear</h1>
  <p>Your favorite bear had its beginning many eras ago, but in the Q1 of 2019, he has chosen to go out in the world and spread his name.
     With a rocking electric guitar and a lock attached to his ear he keeps everyone safe by securing accounts into his special notebook,
   right next to his songs. All you gotta do is to cut some sort of a deal with him by telling your secret (your special pass, dum-dum), and you are
    set to be taken care of. Its like giving in your soul, but its only about passwords. And it's safe.</p>

  <p>Designed and created by a small kid with huge dreams and apirations.</p>
  <p>Also, thanks for downloading the app and using the bear. Not literaly.</p>
